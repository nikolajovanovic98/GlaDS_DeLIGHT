### Glacier Drainage System (GlaDS) model from Werder et al. (2013)

Configuring GlaDS for application to land-terminating glaciers worldwide for the purposes of producing training data and emulating it with a neural operator.

The process consists of (1) obtaining an ice mask from RGI using the OGGM shop and generating a mesh via gmsh, (2) initialising a DEM using ice thickness inversions from IGM, and (3) running GlaDS.
